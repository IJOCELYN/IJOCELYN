## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jocelyn! 
ðŸŽ“ Junior at New York University, studying Computer Science 

Iâ€™m interested in computer science, data science, and healthcare as well as the intersection between these three fields. Currently, Iâ€™m an AI/ML fellow at Break Through Tech, and I completed a certification on machine learning. I really enjoyed learning about various machine learning and data science topics as well as data analysis techniques. I think that thereâ€™s a lot of potential in these fields, and Iâ€™m particularly excited about their applications in healthcare and medicine. I think that machine learning and computer science can be applied to improve healthcare and medicine, such as through the improvements in disease diagnosis and the implementation of telemedicine, which can help improve health outcomes and increase access to quality healthcare. Iâ€™m excited to explore these potential applications and intersectionality of healthcare, computer science, and machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

## ðŸš€ Featured Project: AI-Enhanced Customer Interaction Assistant For DXC Technology 
* _What We Did_: We built an AI chat bot where users can track the status of their packages, ask for personalized product recommendations, and use image search. We used word embeddings, TF-idf vectorizer, and cosine similarity to determine which products to recommend to customers.
